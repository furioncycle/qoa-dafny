# Quite Ok Audio Format (QOA): Implementation in Dafny

:construction: Not working and will be changing 

##  What is Dafny 

[Dafny](https://dafny.org/) is a programming language and verification tool that can transpile to 
various languages (i.e. `Go`, `C#`, etc)

## Why Dafny

Formal verification became an interesting topic the start of this year and following `Dominik Tornow` on Twiiter, got me more into Distributed Systems and how to test correctly. 

`Dominic Szablewski` brought up the challenge to create a decoder in your
favorite language to help with flushing out the [spec](https://twitter.com/phoboslab/status/1636772452930838528).

During this time, I stumbled upon K. Rustan M. Leino's [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CIYKpCNMHc), while learning
about his book `Program Proofs` (which I highly recommend) through `Dominik`. 

I took up the challenge and what best way to flush out the spec by writing some formal proofs and learning the language Dafny.

In the end, I hope that I will be able to push Dafny and formal verification into my work environment

## How to :thinking:

`Currently`: 
  -  Verification of decoder only

`TODO`:
  - Main to actually decode examples/tests
  - Transpiled code as output to be used


## Main Goals
  - Bring Dafny into the work environment
  - Implement QOA decoder/encoder in Dafny
